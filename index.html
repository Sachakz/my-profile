				  	<h2>Tennis</h2>
				  	<p>I've always been passionate about tennis. In fact, I've been playing this sport since the age of 3. My father passed on his passion to me. I've competed in the past. I was also a tennis coach for beginners for 2 years at my club in Haute-Savoie. Tennis is an important part of my life.

				  	<h2>Music</h2>
				  	<p>One of my passions is music. In the past, I played acoustic guitar for several years. I also listen to a lot of music. My favorite style is American rap. I've developed a good knowledge of this musical genre as I've been listening to it since the beginning of secondary school.

				  	<h2>Winter Sports</h2>
				  	<p>My passion is winter sports. Since I've lived next to the French Alps all my life, I've been skiing and snowboarding every winter since I was 5. I have a good level in both disciplines but have never competed. The mountains are one of my favourite destinations.

				  	<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
				  	<p>I'm passionate about the world of graphic design. It's a rather atypical passion that I developed during my high school years. I was fascinated by the world of logos and advertisements, with their intelligent choice of colors, shapes, text, etc. I also did an internship with a graphic designer.
